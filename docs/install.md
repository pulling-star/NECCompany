# Installation

NSec is [available as a NuGet package from
nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSec.Cryptography/). It can be added
to a project in a number of ways, depending on the project type and available
tools:


#### dotnet CLI

    $ dotnet add package NSec.Cryptography --version 18.2.0-preview1


#### Visual Studio

    PM> Install-Package NSec.Cryptography -Version 18.2.0-preview1

#### .csproj

    <PackageReference Include="NSec.Cryptography" Version="18.2.0-preview1"/>

!!! Note
    This is a pre-release version of NSec.
    There may be some (minor) breaking changes until the release.


## Supported Languages

Using NSec requires **C# 7.2** or later. A C# 7.2 compiler is included in the
.NET Core SDK beginning with version 2.1 and in Visual Studio beginning with
version 15.5.

Projects using NSec need to opt into C# 7.2 by setting the [Language
Version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/advanced-build-settings-dialog-box-csharp)
to **latest** or **7.2** (or later).

Additional operating systems and versions should work as well but are not
tested.

Using NSec on Windows requires the [Visual C++ 2015
Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587).
This dependency is automatically installed by the .NET Core installer but may
not be present, for example, when deploying a self-contained application.

The implementation of AES-GCM in NSec is hardware-accelerated and requires a
processor with the Intel SSSE3, AES-NI, and CLMUL extensions. The availability
of these extensions can be checked at runtime with the static `IsSupported`
property of the `NSec.Cryptography.Aes256Gcm` class.
