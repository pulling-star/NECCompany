[NSec](https://nsec.rocks/) is a new cryptographic library for
[.NET Core](https://dot.net/) based on
[libsodium](https://libsodium.org/) &#x2764;.
It provides modern cryptographic primitives in a modern API based on the new
`Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` types. NSec aims to be easy to use, secure by
default, fast, and agile.

NSec runs on .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0, and later on Windows, Linux and Mac.
Using NSec requires a **C# 7.2** or later compiler (included in Visual Studio
2017 and the .NET Core SDK beginning with versions 15.5 and 2.1, respectively).
