[NSec](https://nsec.rocks/) is a new cryptographic library for
[.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) based on
[libsodium](https://libsodium.org/) &#x2764;.
It provides modern cryptographic primitives in a modern API based on the new
`Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` types. It aims to be easy to use, secure by
default, fast and agile.
